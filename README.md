## VLAD ANDREI CHIRIAC

Ex Senior Logistics Manager, Software Developer in the making. Currently a student at Makers. In the past 8 years, I have been working within the Construction Industry, in some of the most prestigious projects in London. Given that the Construction Industry boomed in the past few years, I like to think that I contributed to at least 1% of the projects.

Having worked with a large number of people on a daily basis and having been responsible for a team of 43 people, I value team work, creativity and integrity.

By completing Makers Academy, I am keen to enter the world of tech as a Junior Full Stack Developer. I am very excited for a future of dynamic change, of new and revolutionary technologies that have the possbility of drastically changing the world we live in.
