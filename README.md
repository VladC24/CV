I am a dynamic and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer, keen to enter the world of tech in a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to product management and business strategy. 

In the past 8 years, I have been working within the Construction Industry in some of the most prestigious projects in London. Overall I like to think I contributed to at least 1% of these projects. Having worked in a fast paced environment, with a large number of people on a daily basis, I value team work, honesty and integrity.

Throughout my experience at Makers Academy, I have understood the importance of best coding practices and this is my biggest priority in looking for my next role.  I would love to work in a committed and supportive team, where these practices are adhered to. 
 
I am excited for a future of dynamic change, of new and revolutionary technologies that have the possibility of drastically changing the world we live in. 

__Tech Skills__ : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, C#, Unity3D

## Skills

#### Strategic planner

By managing a team of 12 people in my first role as a project manager, I achieved maximum performance (awarded with
Perfect Delivery Certificate) and finished the project 10% under the expenditure budget, by making
the best use of time and resources. 
Motivated and encouraged teamwork within the workforce to ensure set productivity targets are met.

#### Communication

While at Makers Academy I worked collaboratively with my colleagues on multiple group projects under tight deadlines; good communication and constant feedback was vital for maintaining code quality. I also coached two students from the junior cohort, helping them navigate through Makers' challenges.

In my previous role as a Senior Logistics Manager I was responsible for providing project updates during weekly briefings with the client senior management team and leading weekly logistics meetings with the 27 contractors on site. As part of my role I was also responsible for managing and developing Health & Safety announcements and posters for all the workforce on site (approx.700 people). 

#### Leadership

In one of the key projects at Makers (Acebook), I took the lead in upskilling the team in Ruby on Rails, mobbing the first feature - the sign-up process. This way all members of the team got introduced to Ruby on Rails and Active Record, thus making the pairing process in the following days more effective, as everyone got to understand how Rails works.

In the past, in order to manage a team of 43 people effectively and increase productivity I established a weekly process, consisting of daily briefings, prioritisation of workload and status reports with the team leads. Over the course of 1.5 years my team was awarded five times with the first place for achieving the highest overall score on Health and Safety, Quality, Environment and Sustainability.

#### Self motivation

Working in a fast-paced environment made me understand the value of self-progression. I have always thrived to improve my existing skills by learning and developing myself. I started learning how to code while working full time in a job that constantly required my focus and attention. In the past year I learned the fundamentals in computer programming, HTML, CSS and Ruby and also have achieved a PRINCE2 certification. Before Makers I could create the simplest of web pages. Today I can create full stack applications using technologies such as Ruby on Rails (see my contribution to [Acebook](https://github.com/VladC24/acebook-d-railed)) and Javascript(see [Thermostat](https://github.com/VladC24/Thermostat)).

#### Adaptability

Changing projects almost every year in my previous job roles gave me the confidence I needed to learn new skills and thrive in a challenging environment.

During the Makers Academy course, I have proactively sought out new challenges, as I believe this is the best way to cultivate a growth mindset. I am capable to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently; proof are the projects I have completed while at Makers (one of them being a single page app in Javascript that shows the Guardian news of the day, where I learned how to use APIs - [NewsApp](https://github.com/VladC24/news-summary-challenge/blob/master/README.md)).
