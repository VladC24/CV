I am a dynamic and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer, keen to enter the world of tech in a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to product management and business strategy. 

In the past 8 years, I have been working within the Construction Industry in some of the most prestigious projects in London. Overall I like to think I contributed to at least 1% of these projects. Having worked in a fast paced environment, with a large number of people on a daily basis, I value team work, honesty and integrity.

Throughout my experience at Makers Academy, I have understood the importance of best coding practices and this is my biggest priority in looking for my next role.  I would love to work in a committed and supportive team, where these practices are adhered to. 

__Tech Skills__ : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, C#, Unity3D

## Skills

#### Strategic planning

Having worked on a variety of projects at Makers Academy, setting objectives and focusing on code architecture and design, enabled me to work towards achieving projects' goals in the most efficient and effective way. Proof are the team projects built, such as [Acebook](https://github.com/VladC24/acebook-d-railed).

Being introduced to project management in the last 4 years, I really enjoyed bringing projects to a successful end with maximum efficiency. I enjoyed leading and developing small to large teams as well as solving complex and strategic problems. 
By managing a team of 12 people in my first role as a project manager, I achieved maximum performance (awarded with
Perfect Delivery Certificate) and finished the project 10% under the expenditure budget, by making
the best use of time and resources.

#### Communication

Both at Makers Academy and in my previous career I developed strong communication and stakeholder management skills. 
While at Makers Academy I worked collaboratively with my colleagues on multiple group projects in an agile environment and under tight deadlines. My ability to communicate the problems I face when coding, as well as explaining what I intend to do in a simple, yet understandable manner, is what helped me succeed in my pairing sessions and group projects at Makers. Good communication and feedback in pairing sessions was great for actively learning and have better productivity and code quality. I also coached two students from the junior cohort, helping them navigate through Makers' challenges.

In my previous role as a Senior Logistics Manager regular consultation with senior stakeholders was essential to ensure that project requirements were agreed and a delivery solution was negotiated.

#### Leadership

In one of the key projects at Makers ([Acebook](https://github.com/VladC24/acebook-d-railed)), I took the lead in upskilling the team in Ruby on Rails, mobbing the first feature - the sign-up process. This way all members of the team got introduced to Ruby on Rails and Active Record, thus making the pairing process in the following days more effective, as everyone got to understand how Rails works.

In the past, in order to manage a large team effectively and increase productivity, I established a weekly process consisting of daily briefings, prioritisation of workload and status reports with the team leads. Over the course of 1.5 years my team was awarded five times with the first place for achieving the highest overall score on Health and Safety, Quality, Environment and Sustainability.

#### Self motivation

Working in a fast-paced environment made me understand the value of self-progression. I have always thrived to improve my existing skills by learning and developing myself. I started learning how to code while working full time in a job that constantly required my focus and attention. In the past year I learned the fundamentals in computer programming, HTML, CSS and Ruby and also have achieved a PRINCE2 certification. Before Makers I could create the simplest of web pages. Today I can create full stack applications using technologies such as Ruby on Rails (see my contribution to [Acebook](https://github.com/VladC24/acebook-d-railed)) and Javascript(see [Thermostat](https://github.com/VladC24/Thermostat)).

#### Adaptability

Changing projects almost every year in my previous job roles gave me the confidence I needed to learn new skills and thrive in a challenging environment.

During the Makers Academy course, I have proactively sought out new challenges, as I believe this is the best way to cultivate a growth mindset. I am capable to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently; also able to deal with sudden or frequent changes on coding projects, by continuing to work and understand what is required to be changed in the code; proof are the projects I have completed while at Makers (one of them being a single page app in Javascript that shows the Guardian news of the day, where I learned how to use APIs - [NewsApp](https://github.com/VladC24/news-summary-challenge/blob/master/README.md)).
