## VLAD ANDREI CHIRIAC

I am an dynamic and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer, keen to enter the world of tech in a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to product management and business strategy. 

In the past 8 years, I have been working within the Construction Industry, in some of the most prestigious projects in London. Given that the Construction Industry boomed in the past few years, I like to think that I contributed to at least 1% of the projects. Having worked with a large number of people on a daily basis, I value team work, creativity and integrity. 

Throughout my experience at Makers Academy, I have understood the importance of best coding practices and this is my biggest priority in looking for a Junior Developer job.  Would love to work in a commited and supportive team, where these practices are adhered to.

I am very excited for a future of dynamic change, of new and revolutionary technologies that have the possbility of drastically changing the world we live in.
